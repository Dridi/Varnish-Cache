Actions
=======

Actions are used with the ``return(<action>)`` keyword, which returns
control from subroutines back to varnish. The action determines how
processing in varnish continues as shown in :ref:`reference-states`.

The :ref:`builtin_vcl` is documented in the VCL reference manual and
describes common actions.
